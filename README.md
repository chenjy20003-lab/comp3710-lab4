# COMP3710 Lab 4 - Recognition Problems (VAE, CIFAR-10, etc.)

This repository contains my solutions for **Part 4: Recognition Problems** in COMP3710.  
All code was written using **PyTorch** without using pre-trained models, in line with lab requirements.  
Each task has been implemented, trained, and tested on the UQ HPC cluster (Rangpur). （but still pending）
